# 🥷🏽 Vue administration project

## 🦄 Features

Here's a quick overview of what you currently can do with my administration system. (Further updates do happen):

- **Logging in**: You can log in only with the at forehand given login details.

- **CRUD customers**: You have a crud where you can view, filter, add, edit and delete all your customers.

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

I came up with this idea to learn vue but I did not know how. That's why I though, let's start a small side project and see how it goes.

That's when I came up with a administration system. Because even I do everything on paper or in word / excel and that can be a bit frustrating at times. That's why I created my own application. 2 birds with 1 stone, I learn vue and I get to do my administration smarter.

I plan on making this application as sufisticated so that I can do all my administration online. I remove the need to use paper, word or excel completely. After that I could have ideas of making it public and sharing it to the market. I don't know about that yet, we'll see where the wind takes me.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've picked up important skills and a better understanding of complex ideas, which improved my logical thinking. Because this was a bigger project I learned to work alone on certain parts and ask for help where needed.

### 🧠 Brain:

- **Logical Thinking**: Working with a complete new programming language for the first time and on top front-end and backend, required some logical thinking.

### ⌚ Time management:

- **Using scrum board**: Keeping track of all our tasks using a scrum board really made everything organised. For this project I used Trello.

### 📓 New knowledge:

- **Vue**: First time using vue as front-end development programming languague.
- **Auth0**: This is what we used for authentication, I did have a bit of experience before but this just boosted it even higher.
- **Node + express**: Creating our database and running api calls was all with the help of node js api and and express.js.
- **Vercel**: Hosted my website on vercel because I have good experiences with it.

### 📈 Overall Growth:

Each part of this project helped me understand more about building apps, managing complex information, and improving user experience. It was more than just making a borrowing system. It was about solving problems, learning new things, and improving my skills for future work.

## 💭 How can it be improved?

- Styling the application more
- Implementing more features
- Security
